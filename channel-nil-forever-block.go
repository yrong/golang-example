/**
WaitMany() looks like a good way to wait for channels a and b to close, but it has a problem.
Letâ€™s say that channel a is closed first, then it will always be ready to receive.
Because bclosed is still false the program can enter an infinite loop,
preventing the channel b from ever being closed.
A safe way to solve the problem is to leverage the blocking properties of a nil channel and rewrite the program like this
In the rewritten WaitMany() we nil the reference to a or b once they have received a value.
When a nil channel is part of a select statement, it is effectively ignored,
so niling a removes it from selection, leaving only b which blocks until it is closed,
exiting the loop without spinning.
